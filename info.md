Cleanmate
============================================

Let Home Assistant take controll over your Cleanmate vacuum

## Install using HACS

* If you haven't already you must have [HACS installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).
* Go into HACS and search for Cleanmate under the Integrations headline. Install it. You will need to restart Home Assistant to finish the process.
* Once that is done, try to reload your GUI (caching issues could prevent the integration to be shown).
* Goto Integrations and add Cleanmate
* Follow the configuration flow
